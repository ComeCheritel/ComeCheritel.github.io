[comment]: <> (Pendant mon passage en tant que volontaire au sein de la cellule de crise des hopitaux de Paris lors de la première vague de la crise, j'ai eu l'opportunité de participe à la création d'indicateurs avancés permettant le monitoring de l'épidémie ainsi qu'une prise de décision mieux informée. La description de ces indicateurs avancés a été ensuite décrite dans une publication du COVID-19 APHP-UNIVERSITIES-INRIA-INSERM GROUP dans la revue Plos One.)
